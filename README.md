# CaseStudy2DDS
In this project, the CEO and CFO of Frito Lay wanted me to analyze employee data to pinpoint key drivers of attrition and reveal job role-specific satisfaction trends. My models successfully identified factors influencing employee turnover and monthly income, guiding effective retention strategies. Interactive visualizations furthered our understanding of income distribution, while statistical analysis refined our approach, culminating in actionable insights for optimizing talent management and bolstering employee retention.
